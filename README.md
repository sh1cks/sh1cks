- 👋 Hi, I’m @sh1cks
- 👀 I’m interested in a multitude of subjects and activities from web design and coding to playing the piano and violin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Scraping through the platforms Udemy and DataCamp. I'm taking on this learning path so that I can bolster my skills at work. Although web scraping is not part of my job description, I see many use cases for it in my field of advertising. My goal is to create a web scraper that will be able to list the order of products on a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) over time. This will allow us to see our product placement as we increase advertising spend.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects I feel comfortable contributing to. I don't have specific ideas for collaboration in mind at this time, however.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't want to provide my information publicly. You may reach out to me on LinkedIn (Shawn Hicks), or through GitHub itself if there is a way to send messages on this platform. I am new here and in the process of learning.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I absolutely love horror movies and horror or suspense / thriller and psychological thriller books. I'm currently reading My Heart is a Chainsaw by Stephen Graham Jones, as of April 2024. If you're reading this later than April 2024, I'm definitely already on a different book.
